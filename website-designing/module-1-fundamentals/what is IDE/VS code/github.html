what is github ? 
GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to host and review code, manage projects, and collaborate with others. GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in source code during software development. It provides features such as repositories, branches, pull requests, and issues to facilitate teamwork and streamline the development process. GitHub is widely used by individual developers, open-source projects, and organizations to share code and collaborate on software projects.

what is git ?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. Git tracks changes to files over time, enabling users to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate on code. Key features of Git include branching and merging, which allow developers to create separate lines of development and later integrate them back into the main codebase. Git is widely used in software development for its robustness, flexibility, and support for collaborative workflows.
