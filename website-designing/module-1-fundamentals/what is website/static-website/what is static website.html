what is static website  ?

A static website is a type of website that delivers fixed content to users. Unlike dynamic websites, which generate content on-the-fly based on user interactions or server-side processing, static websites consist of pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served directly to the user's browser.


Static websites are typically easier to create and host, as they do not require server-side scripting or databases. They are ideal for simple websites, such as portfolios, blogs, or informational sites, where the content does not change frequently. Static websites can be hosted on various platforms, including traditional web hosting services, content delivery networks (CDNs), and even version control platforms like GitHub Pages.
