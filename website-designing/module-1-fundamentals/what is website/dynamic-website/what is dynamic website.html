what is dynamic website  ?
A dynamic website is a type of website that generates content in real-time based on user interactions, preferences, or other factors. Unlike static websites, which display the same content to all users, dynamic websites can change their content and layout dynamically. This is typically achieved through server-side scripting languages such as PHP, ASP.NET, or JavaScript frameworks like Node.js. Dynamic websites often use databases to store and retrieve data, allowing for features such as user accounts, personalized content, and interactive elements. Examples of dynamic websites include social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and content management systems (CMS).
